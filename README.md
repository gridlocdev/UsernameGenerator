# Username Generator

## Overview

This is a console application that randomly generates usernames in a title-case format (e.g. "AdjectiveNoun") with roughly-specific syllable lengths.

## Known Bugs

- English is a language that often doesn't play by a consistent set of phonetic rules, and as a result the syllable detection count may be occasionally off by one based on the word endings.
