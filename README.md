# Username Generator

## Overview

This is a set of applications to generate usernames in a title-case format (e.g. "WordWord") with specific criteria such as character count and syllable lengths.

## Known Bugs

- English is a language that often doesn't play by a consistent set of phonetic rules, and as a result the count of syllables detected may be occasionally off by one based on the word endings.
